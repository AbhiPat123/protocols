A fork of the RaftScope project (https://github.com/ongardie/raftscope) extended to also visualize:

* Paxos[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)]
* PBFT(Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)[http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf]

Codebase was refactored to also allow future visualizations of other protocols.

after you clone, run the following to get the dependencies:
    git submodule update --init --recursive
